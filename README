This is a quantum mechanics simulation

It take an initial wavefunction as an input
Then simulates the time evolution of probability density according to Schordinger's Equation
for 1 dimensional particle in a box with infinite potential wall at x = 0 and x = L
-hBar^2 / 2m gradient(psi) = E * psi = i partial (psi) / partial (time)

The input function should follow the usual restrictions on the wave functions
psi should be infinitely differentiable
Boundary conditions: psi(0) = psi(L) = 0
